1. WebSocket is a communications protocol. It provides full-duplex ocmmunication channels over a single TCP connection.
2. Long-polling is a technique used to push updates to a web client. A connection is held open between the web client and the web server so that when the server has new information it can push it to the client.
   On the client you need to set up an event loop, where upon timeout or success of a request to the server, the client would continually request the server for new information.
   On the server needs to subscribed to the message bus. In which it listens for requests. Then there is a publisher that causes events based on the request to push data back to the client.
3. You should use WebSockets instead of long-polling because it's server has the only process serving any requests. No loops, memory/CPU expense per client, but per client action. The Client is natively implemented in the browser, and takes minimum resources. Compared to long-polling, which the server takes little of CPU resources, but creates idle processes per user expending server memeory and the client depends on implementation.
4. Client class constructor does creates a client for each player connecting to the game. This creates a new websocket, player, and there own set of methods for talking to the server.
5. The methods of the Client must bind because you need a new version of that method to bind to the websocket created for that client.
6. Phaser is a 2d game multiplayer client/socket game.
